## Bad smell stories

- There are programmers who are not campable of completing this project since they have been trying to conform to using the tool. There is a learning curve between learning the language for the project which is extending the schedule.

Stink[('ltex','pcap')] = Stink[('sced','acap')] = \
Stink[('sced','pexp')] = Stink[('sced','pcap')] = \
Stink[('sced','aexp')] = [
 [4,2,1,0,0,0],
 [2,1,0,0,0,0],
 [1,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0]]

- We don't have the amount of main memory requirements expected for this project. The analyst on the team  had difficultilies understanding what was expected of this project and now we are in a pickle.


Stink[('cplx','acap')] = Stink[('cplx','pcap')] = \
Stink[('cplx','tool')] = Stink[('stor','acap')] = \
Stink[('time','acap')] = Stink[('ruse','aexp')] = \
Stink[('ruse','ltex')] = Stink[('Pmat','pcap')] = \
Stink[('stor','pcap')] = Stink[('time','pcap')] = [
 [0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [1,0,0,0,0,0],
 [2,1,0,0,0,0],
 [4,2,1,0,0,0]]


 - The analyst on the team have issues understanding the task and designing it appropriately. The main issue with this is that we have human lives at stake. The fact the programmers may not be capable to bounce back from any disasterous events makes this a scary situation. 


Stink[('rely','acap')] = Stink[('rely','Pmat')] = \
Stink[('rely','pcap')] = [
 [0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [1,0,0,0,0,0],
 [2,1,0,0,0,0],
 [4,2,1,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0]]
