# Theory 3

## Three Key Differnces between flight and ground:
1.  There is 1 more values for the reliability factor (rely) for ground but the additional number is low.
	- This can be interepretted as the associated risk seem less.

2. 	The range of lines of code(kloc) is smaller for ground.
	- The values leads to a more confident/precise analysis of the project

3. 	The program complexity(cplx) values for flight are higher [3,4,5,6] and ground is [1,2,3,4]
	- They have the same number of values but the intensity is higher for the flight project.

## Three Key Differences between osp and osp2:
1. Development flexibility(Flex) for osp2 only has a subset of the values liste in osp.
	- osp Flex= [2,3,4,5] v.s. osp2 Flex=[3]

2. In osp2 the dimension of runtime pressure(time) has been added.
	- This can be considered as one of the additions that can are added to scope as a project grows.

3. The number of values associated with process maturity(pmat) is now smaller and considers higher values in osp2.
	- osp Pmat = [1,2,3,4] v.s. osp2 Pmat = [4,5]


Overall it seems as though during the estaimation of the second version osp the team felt more confident about what to expect in the project incomparison to the first version of osp 1.
